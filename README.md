🔷 Computer Graphics Lab

A collection of implemented graphics algorithms using Python & OpenGL

🌟 Overview

This repository contains all hands-on laboratory implementations for the Computer Graphics course.
Each lab focuses on the algorithmic side of graphics, where every shape is drawn mathematically — not with built-in functions.

These labs build the foundation for understanding how real computer graphics systems work behind the scenes.
