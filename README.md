## 🌟 Overview
**Catch the Diamonds** is a colorful arcade-style mini-game created using **Python (PyOpenGL)**.  
Move your catcher left and right to catch the falling diamonds — but miss one, and it’s game over!  

This project demonstrates how **computer graphics algorithms** can be applied to create real-time interactive games with pixel-perfect precision.

## 🎨 Features
- **Pure Algorithmic Drawing:**  
  All shapes, diamonds, and UI elements are drawn using **Midpoint Line Algorithm** (Zone-based).

- **Dynamic Gameplay:**  
  Diamonds fall faster as your score increases, making the game progressively challenging.

- **Interactive UI Elements:**  
  - ⏸️ Pause / Play button  
  - 🔁 Restart button (arrow icon)  
  - ❌ Exit button (cross icon)

- **Smooth Controls:**  
  - ⬅️ Move Left  
  - ➡️ Move Right  
  - **R** key to Restart

- **Bright, Random Colors:**  
  Diamonds appear with bright randomized colors for a visually appealing experience.
